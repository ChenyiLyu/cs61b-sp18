This repository is for [aviatesk][aviatesk]'s self-learning of algorithms and data structure with the materials for [CS61B][CS61B], which is taught at UC Berkeley in Spring 2018 by Josh Hug.
  
Beyond of all, I really, really appreciate that this great learning-materials is made public, and want to say an infinite thanks to the instructor Josh and everyone who contributed to his lecture.

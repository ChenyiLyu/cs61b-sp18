This repository is for [aviatesk]'s self-learning of algorithms and data structure with the materials for [CS61B], taught at UC Berkeley in Spring 2018 by Josh Hug.
  
Beyond of all, I really, really appreciate this great learning-materials is made public, and want to say the infinite thanks to the instructor Josh and everyone who contributed to his lecture.
